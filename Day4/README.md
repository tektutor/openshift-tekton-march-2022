# Installing a multi-pod WordPress with maridb application
```
oc delete project jegan
oc new-project jegan
oc new-app mariadb-ephemeral
oc new-app php~https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress
oc logs -f deploy/wordpress
oc expose svc/wordpress
oc get routes
```

When you click on the wordpress route, it would prompt for certain details
you need to give the database name shown in the terminal when you deployed mariadb

username - root
password - root password shown in the terminal
hostname - mariadb.ocp.svc.cluster.local

The hostname you need to replace it with the hostname you see in Administrator --> Networking --> Services --> mariadb --> Hostname

## What is a Custom Resource in Kubernetes/OpenShift ?
- an API extension mechanism in Kubernetes/OpenShift
- helps you add a new kind of object in your Kubernetes/OpenShift Cluster 
  just like Deployment, ReplicaSet, Pod, etc.,
- a Custom Resource Definition(CRD) defines a Custom Resource(CR)
- once a CR is created using CRD it can be accessed using kubectl or oc commands

## What is an Operator in Kubernetes/OpenShift?
Some references
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/

- an Operator is a custom Kubernetes/OpenShift Controller that waches a CR
- Custom Controllers monitors CR, compares its desired with actual state, 
  if it deviates takes appropriate actions
- Operators helps
  - scaling up/down a Custom Resource
  - upgrading a CR from one version to another
  - engineers & developers who would like to extend Kubernetes API to manage their site 
    and software

- it lets you define Operators declaratively

## What is Operator Metering?
